"This was my first attempt at web development. I used HTML and some CSS within the <style> tag. The elements I used include HTML tags such as <h1>, <h2>, and <p>. I also used <main>, <div>, <table>, <header>, and <footer>. Additionally, I applied CSS properties like margin, color, border, and padding."
